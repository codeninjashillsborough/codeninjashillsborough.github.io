                        the rules of the dojo. If any student becomes violent, aggressive, disrespectful or

                        and such dismissal shall not relieve Parent of any duties or payment obligations already

                        participation of the Child in accordance with the Program&rsquo;s curriculum. Please see the

                        other students or other programs such as camps. &nbsp;All &quot;Day Camps&quot;, &quot;Holiday
                        Camps&quot;, &quot;Summer Camps&quot;, and &quot;Specialty Programs&quot; are an extra fee and
                        not included in the Create/Junior DI program membership. During Camps, students cannot come in
                        to do DI hours (they can only come during the normal DI hours.) Parents are responsible to keep
                        track of their hours. We do not track hours but may audit a student&apos;s login record if abuse
                        is suspected.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Emergency Medical Treatment</strong></p>
                    <p>In the event of a medical emergency, the Program staff will first use reasonable efforts to
                        contact the parent(s) and/or guardian(s) before administering or authorizing any treatment.
                        However, the Parent understands that Provider does not have medical personnel available at the
                        Facility. &nbsp;Parent agrees and hereby grants Provider permission to authorize emergency
                        medical treatment, if necessary, to Child. Parent understands and agrees that the Provider
                        assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage which might arise out of or in connection
                        with such authorized emergency medical treatment. Parent further states that there are no
                        undisclosed health-related reasons or problems which preclude or restricts Child from
                        undertaking the Program, and that Child has adequate health insurance to provide for and pay any
                        medical costs that may be attendant as a result of injury to Child. Parent further acknowledges
                        that it is the Parent&rsquo;s sole responsibility to notify, inform, and update Provider of any
                        medical conditions of Child, including but not limited to known drug and food allergies, known
                        dietary restrictions, and other medical conditions. Please leave an EpiPen/Auvie-Q with your
                        child at all times, if one is required. <strong>We are a&nbsp;nut-free facility.</strong> Please
                        do not send any food or drinks that contain nut products. <strong>We have a zero-tolerance
                            policy for nuts and take allergies very seriously.</strong></p>
                    <p><br></p>

                    <p><strong>Acknowledgment, Acceptance, and Assumption of Risks</strong></p>
                    <p>This document provides and imparts enough warning that dangerous conditions, risks and hazards
                        risks inherent in utilizing the Program. Parent understands that Child&rsquo;s presence and
                        participation in the Program may expose them to such dangerous conditions, risks and hazards,
                        which include, but are not limited to, theft or destruction of personal property, personal
                        injury of Child or Parent at the Facility, including those injuries caused by another child,
                        virus and communicable disease such as COVID-19 or the flu, and all other foreseeable injuries
                        to Child or myself arising out of the Program. On behalf of Parent and Child, the undersigned
                        Parent, voluntarily signs this Waiver and Assumption of Risk on behalf of myself and Child in
                        favor of Provider, in consideration for the opportunity to have my Child participate in the
                        Program(s) offered by Provider, and engage in other activities sponsored by Provider, including
                        but not limited to: interactions with staff and other students, interaction with computer
                        technology and the internet, consumption of food, and any indoor or outdoor activities related
                        to the curriculum or Program(s). I hereby attest and verify I have been sufficiently advised of
                        the potential risks, and I have full knowledge of the risks of my Child&rsquo;s involvement in
                        these activities. I assume any and all expenses incurred in the event of an accident, illness,
                        or another incapacity, regardless of whether I have authorized such expenses. Knowing the
                        dangers, hazards, and risks of such activities and in consideration of my Child&rsquo;s
                        participation in the Program, I also agree to assume all risks inherent of my Child&rsquo;s
                        violation of the laws of the State of NJ, as well as any violation of the Program code of
                        conduct.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Child Pickup/Leave Authorization</strong></p>
                    <p>Students should be picked up promptly at the end of their checked in time. After 15 minutes,
                        students will be scanned in for another hour. If no hours remain, may be subject to late fees.
                        Parents must come inside to get students -or- at least pull up to the sidewalk in their vehicle
                        and call the desk. No child is permitted to run out into the parking lot alone. No child is
                        permitted to wait outside or at a neighboring business for a ride home. Parents/guardians must
                        inform Code Ninjas of the name of the person who is picking up their child on any day when they
                        themselves are not. The &ldquo;Authorized Pick-Up Person&rdquo; must be at least 18 years old
                        and may be asked to provide a photo ID to the staff. This authorization shall remain in force
                        until edited or rescinded in writing by the signers of this authorization. Please specify your
                        authorization in the Emergency Contact form section.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p><strong>Destruction of Property</strong></p>
                    <p>If a student is observed willfully destroying or damaging property (not by normal wear and tear),
                        Parent assumes responsibility to repair/replace destroyed/damaged property. Code Ninjas
                        franchisees use camera surveillance which records and can determine if a student did willfully
                        damage/destroy property.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></p>
                    <p>Code Ninjas Hillsborough&apos;s students are expected to follow our Code of Conduct at all times-
                        whether inside the Dojo or online for a class with Code Ninjas. We treat each other, our
                        Sensei&apos;s, our Dojo, and equipment with respect at all times. There is no bullying, hitting,
                        pushing, shoving, name-calling, screaming, cursing, threatening, cyber-bullying, hazing,
                        demeaning, racism, bias, or otherwise mistreating any fellow students or employees. Students
                        must follow the rules of the Dojo and work on the Curriculum, not go on exterior websites/games
                        without staff permission. Absolutely no profanity, explicit images/videos, or texts/messages
                        tolerated. We have a family-friendly atmosphere and positive culture in the Dojo. We want all
                        our students to feel safe, supported, and happy here. Violation of the Code of Conduct can
                        result in: Time Out, Parent Phone Call/Conference, or Student Suspension/ Student Termination
                        without refund (depending on severity).</p>
